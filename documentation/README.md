### LODESTechDoc.pdf

This file holds the most recent released technical document on data structure and variables used in LODES 8.4 version release. This file is important because a few variables are defined in relation to the jobs data used in this repository. The WAC is the table that is used and brought in using `sql/employment/get_lodes_data.sql` which uses the varibales `[SEG]`, `[TYPE]`, and `[CNS01] - [CNS20]` and is the only place where a description of these variables currently exist. The file was originally downloaded from this [link](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/doc/help/onthemap/LODESTechDoc.pdf)
